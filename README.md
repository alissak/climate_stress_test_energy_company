# Stress Testing an Energy Company

## Step 1:

Read the motivations for conducting a climate stress test of a firm ([pdf link](https://github.com/rht/climate_stress_test_energy_company/blob/main/pdfs%20(read)/Motivation-for-Climate-Stress-Tests.pdf))

## Step 2:

Read the valuation model of the energy company ([pdf link](https://github.com/rht/climate_stress_test_energy_company/blob/main/pdfs%20(read)/Climate-Stress-Testing-an-Energy-Company-Valuation-Model-11-January-2021.pdf)).

## Step 4:

Answer the questions in the assignment ([pdf link](https://github.com/rht/climate_stress_test_energy_company/blob/main/pdfs%20(read)/Assignment-Climate-Stress-Testing-an-Energy-Company.pdf)).

## Step 5:

Prepare a 5-to-7 minute PowerPoint presentation of your findings, with the following structure:
* Show and critically discuss findings on the core questions (2 min).
* Show and discuss findings on the transition & technology scenario questions (2 min).
* Discuss validity and ways to improve your energy company stress test (3 min).

## Notes:

* **DO NOT CHANGE THE CODE**. You do not need to look at the code either to complete the assignment.
* You can look at the default parameters used for the model, but this is not necessary.
