# Illustrative Exercise: Stress Testing an Energy Company

## Step 1:

Read the motivations for conducting a climate stress test of a firm ([pdf link](https://github.com/rht/climate_stress_test_energy_company/blob/main/pdfs/Motivation-for-Climate-Stress-Testing-Econ-101-Climate-Finance-Stanford-Fall-2021.pdf))

## Step 2:

Read the valuation model of the energy company ([pdf link](https://github.com/rht/climate_stress_test_energy_company/blob/main/pdfs/Climate-Stress-Testing-an-Energy-Company-Valuation-Model-12-January-2021-protected.pdf); download the file since it is password protected). The model is also simply described in words without formulas ([pdf link](https://github.com/rht/climate_stress_test_energy_company/blob/main/pdfs/Climate-Stress-Testing-an-Energy-Company-Valuation-Model-in-Words-Protected.pdf); download the file since it is password protected).

## Step 3:

Read the assignment ([pdf link](https://github.com/rht/climate_stress_test_energy_company/blob/main/pdfs/Illustrative-Excercise-Climate-Stress-Testing-an-Energy-Company-Climate-Finance-Course-Fall-2021-Stanford.pdf)).

## Step 4:

Answer the questions in the assignment by conducting a climate stress test of the energy company. Run the climate stress test by clicking on the ‘**Colab**’ button below.

## Step 5:

Prepare a 5-to-7 minute PowerPoint presentation of your findings, with the following structure (see also instructions in pdf link in step 3):
* Show and critically discuss findings on the core questions (2 min).
* Show and discuss findings on the transition & technology scenario questions (2 min).
* Discuss validity and ways to improve your energy company stress test (3 min).

## Notes:

* Do not fork this repository.
* **DO NOT CHANGE THE CODE**. You do not need to look at the code either to complete the assignment.
* You can look at the [default parameters](https://github.com/rht/climate_stress_test_energy_company/blob/main/default_parameters%20(read%20optionally).md) used for the model, but this is not necessary.
